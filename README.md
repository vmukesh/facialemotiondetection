# facialemotiondetection

**Image Classification using Facial Recognition Dataset**
In this research, Convolutional Neural Networks are used to construct a facial expressionÂ recognition system (CNN). The system can recognize seven different facial expressions (angry, disgust, fear, happy, neutral, sad, surprise) in images

**Prerequisites**
Google drive account
Basic knowledge of Python programming language
Familiarity with CNN and image classification

**Getting started**
Open Google Colab and create a new notebook.
Install the dataset from Kaggle from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/samaneheslamifar/facial-emotion-expressions 
Upload the dataset to your google drive in main folder of MyDrive
Then click runall or Ctrl+F9 to start execution
It will ask you to access your google drive, give access and move forward.

**Results**
The trained model achieved an accuracy of around 65% on the validation set. The model can recognize the seven different facial expressions with varying levels of accuracy depending on the complexity and clarity of the input images or frames.
